Die:
- Smooth, satifying movement
- Properly moving from the corner pivots

- Camera smoothing

- Casino aesthetic?
- walls could be card stacks
- takes place on a giant poker table

- Stats after player finishes game (amount of moves, time)
- dice falls down (with speed lines) as GUI shows stats
- dice keeps falling until player hits button, takes player back to main menu

- main menu
- start game, instructions, credits, quit game
- probably not options cuz that's out of scope

- How do I switch between levels? as to not confuse or overwhelm players

Playtesting:
- fixed a softlock (thanks Clone)
- Arina wanted to have a scene reload key
- Z-fighting on doors


Level design:
- could make a puzzle where I open 2 doors at once
- Level where you wrap around into a different level

- music
- sound design
- level assets (getting pretty far with that tbh)
